              <dt>What does &quot;tour difficulty&quot; in the tour description mean? Is &quot;difficult&quot; really difficult?</dt>
              <dd>OK, fair enough question. Difficulty ratings are obviously in the eye of the beholder. At first we used the Class ranking system that US Parks have used for over 75 years. The problem with that system is that it ranks Classes from Class 1 to Class 5. Only Class 1 and 2 refer to hiking, Class 3 and above are reserved for climbing trails. Since only a small portion of our tours have any climbing (and only optional climbing at that) we devised our own difficulty scale. If you are in good physical shape, you should be able to handle anything our tours throw at you. However, the difficult rating is difficult, and you should read the tour description carefully before committing to the tour. Read our difficulties ratings here for more detail.</dd>
              
              <dt>Do I get a refund if the trail was too hard for me?</dt>
              <dd>We're sorry, but no. We feel that between the detailed tour description and the difficulty ranking we have set adequate expectations about what level of physical ability is required for each tour. If you feel a tour might be too difficult for you, please feel free to contact one of our agents, or try one of our easier tours to start out.</dd>
              
              <dt>What can I NOT bring into the camp sites?</dt>
              <dd>For the most part, use common sense. Remember that our camping is in pristine areas of Oregon wilderness, so we have a strict bring-in-in/take-it-out policy. Leaving behind trash or refuse will not be tolerated. Also, drugs and/or weapons are not tolerated in any camping area and will be grounds for immediate cancellation of your tour with no refund. We also ask that you leave your guitars at home. This will prevent any unfortunate &quot;Kumbaya&quot; incidents of having your guitar broken over your head. We appreciate your understanding.</dd>
  
              <dt>Can I use your backpack?</dt>
              <dd>No, bring your own.</dd>
  
              <dt>Do you offer self-guided tours?</dt>
              <dd>Most of our tours can be taken as a self-guided tour. We will provide you with a map, camping sites, and the cell phone number of the main group tour guide. Due to the potentially hazardous nature of the Death Valley Trek and MT. Whitney Climb self-guided tours are not allowed.</dd>
  
              <dt>What do you mean by hazardous?</dt>
              <dd>You could die. We don't want that.</dd>
  
              <dt>Can you recommend some gear?</dt>
              <dd>Yes we can. Take a look at our tour guides gear recommendations</dd>

            <h3>Oregon Calm</h3>
            <dl class="faq">
              <dt>What should a bring to the spa?</dt>
              <dd>Be sure to read your tour description carefully. For the most part, what you need to bring depends upon the package and spa you will be attending. Some spas are full service, and supply all materials, either in room or at the spa itself. If you are not taking an overnight tour, be sure to check with the spa to make sure they have arrangements for storing valuables.</dd>

              <dt>Are massages performed... you know...</dt>
              <dd>Again, it depends upon the spa and your personal preference. Most spas cater to your personal preferences. If you wish to wear the robe only, feel free to do so. Professional massage therapists are trained to drape throughout the massage. It is also quite common for guests to wear under garments or bathing suits.</dd>

              <dt>Are the packages restricted, or can I use all areas of the spa?</dt>
              <dd>In negotiating our tours, we make sure guests have access to the entire spa, regardless of package. If you are not enjoying your spa experience, or would like to try something else, feel free. Please understand that additional charges may apply.</dd>

              <dt>What do I need to tell the spa?</dt>
              <dd>Based on your package, certain spa treatments might be restricted if you are pregnant, nursing, injured, or have specific allergies. Make sure you inform the spa well in advance of your appointment of any current conditions that might prevent you from partaking in your spa treatments. If concerns are caught early enough, the spa will make arrangements for an alternate activity.</dd>
